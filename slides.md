# Photo booth

What is a photo booth?

<v-click>

> A photo booth is a vending machine or modern kiosk that contains an automated, usually coin-operated, camera and film processor. 
> Today, the vast majority of photo booths are digital. - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo_booth)

- It's a great way to entertain guests

# Your options

There are basically two options when it comes to getting a photo booth for your party:

- Rent a photo booth
  - Quite expensive
  - Not fun

- Build a photo booth
  - Relatively cheap (w/o labor & camera)
  - Yours forever

  - The price range is huge - you can get a camera for 50 CHF or 5000 CHF

# Final result

<v-clicks depth="2">

- Poor man's cover

- Easy to transport
- Cover also helps with light diffusion
- Cables are somewhat hidden
- It gets the job done

</v-clicks>


<v-clicks>

### Additionally 

- The photo booth power in the back had a few spare USB plugs => guests can charge their phones

# Camera Setup

<v-clicks every="1">

- You can use _any camera_ [supported by gPhoto / libgphoto2](http://gphoto.org/proj/libgphoto2/support.php).

- You should buy a "Dummy Battery" to avoid running out of power

- Choose a good camera: the camera quality is proportional to the quality of the photos

</v-clicks>

<p v-click>
... but
</p>

# Why is this important?


For tax reasons, any commercial "camera" comes with the following:

<v-clicks every="1">

- Recording time is limited to 29 minutes and 59 seconds

- You cannot show the preview screen to the user for more than this time

- (You can't use it as a webcam for more than 30 minutes)

</v-clicks>

---
layout: fact
---

## Ironically this law doesn't exist anymore...

---
layout: fact
---

## ...but camera manufacturers still introduce / keep this dummy limitation


---

# Trick

To solve the issue:

<v-clicks every="1">

- We ask for a "camera preview" frame

- We send this frame to the frontend

- We ask for the next frame

</v-clicks>
<br/>
<p v-click>
Surprisingly, this works relatively well.
</p>
<p v-click>
... we'll get into the details about this later.

# Printer

<v-clicks every="1">

- BLE printer

- ~30 CHF

- Reverse engineered parts of it

- Eventually got somewhere, but couldn't get it to work in time

- Needless to say, this was not implemented

# LEDs

## Main purpose(s)

<v-clicks every="1">

- Used for ambient light

- Attracting people to the booth

</v-clicks>

---
layout: bullets
---

# Controlling brightness

<v-clicks>

- Controlled by [`lightd`](https://github.com/denysvitali/lightd/tree/master)

- Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)

- Ever wondered why LED lights are flickering when you take a picture?

</v-clicks>

---

# `lightd`

A stupid simple "daemon" to control the brightness of the LED strips

```go{|4}
func main() {
  arg.MustParse(&args)
  e := gin.Default()
  e.POST("/api/v1/set", setLight)
  if err := e.Run(args.ListenAddr); err != nil {
    logger.Fatalf("error starting server: %v", err)
  }
}
```

<v-clicks>

- Used directly by the frontend and by some boot scripts.

- Runs as root üò® (we'll get to this later)

```go {1|2|3|5|6-9|11-14}
dutyCycle := 0.5 // 50% duty cycle
frequency := 100 // 100Hz
periodMs := 1000 / frequency

for {
  // Turn on the light
  gpio.High()
  onTimeMs := int(float64(periodMs) * dutyCycle)
  time.Sleep(time.Millisecond * time.Duration(onTimeMs))
  
  // Turn off the light
  gpio.Low()
  offTimeMs := periodMs - onTimeMs
  time.Sleep(time.Millisecond * time.Duration(offTimeMs))

# PWM Controller

Can be easily used via [stianeikeland/go-rpio](https://github.com/stianeikeland/go-rpio/)

```go
// setBrightness sets the brightness of the LED strip (0-32)
func setBrightness(brightness int) error {
	if err := rpio.Open(); err != nil {
		return fmt.Errorf("error opening GPIO: %v", err)
	}
	defer rpio.Close()

	pin := rpio.Pin(args.GpioPin)
	pin.Mode(rpio.Pwm)
	pin.Freq(64000)
	pin.DutyCycle(uint32(brightness), 32)
	return nil

# The problem

My kernel was compiled with

```
CONFIG_STRICT_DEVMEM=y
```

This means that you cannot access `/dev/mem` directly past its first 1MB.
(Security reasons).

## Solution

<ol class="list-decimal">
  <li>Recompile the kernel</li>
  <li>Patch the function</li>
</ol>

## Note
In any case, only `root` can access `/dev/mem`.

MODULE_PARM_DESC(func, "Patches devmem_is_allowed to always return 1");

# Operating System

## Key Requirements

- Linux

- Must run in Kiosk mode

- Ideally `ro` filesystem

- Just enough to:

  - Connect to Wi-Fi

  - Connect to camera via USB

  - Use LED strip

  - Run UI


<!--
  With the hardware and partially the software figured out,
  we only need to take care of one last thing:
  how are we going to run this in Kiosk mode?

# Why `raspi-alpine/builder`?

<v-clicks depth="2">

- Supports A/B updates

- Images are built with Docker

- You can modify every aspect of the system

  - packages

  - mounts 

  - init scripts

- Filesystem is `ro` by default

- So good that I'm using it for 
  - [my k3s cluster](https://github.com/denysvitali/raspi-k3s)
  - my Karaoke machine üé§

# `photobooth-os`

## Boot Sequence

<v-clicks>

- uboot picks the right partition (A/B)
- kernel loads and `/sbin/init` is called
- init system spawns `lightd`
- `/etc/inittab` is read and `kiosk` autologins
  ```
  tty1::respawn:/sbin/agetty --autologin kiosk --noclear 38400 tty1
  ```
- `/home/kiosk/start.sh` spawns thanks to `.bash_profile`
- `start.sh` calls `supervisord -n`
- `supervisord` spawns:
  - `display_manager.sh`
  - `server` (backend)
  - `frontend`

# `photobooth-os`
## Display Manager

<v-clicks>

- `sway` as a window manager

- Initially supposed to use [cage-kiosk/cage](github.com/cage-kiosk/cage) (Wayland Kiosk) + `chromium`

- Used `chromium --kiosk` instead, which is good enough
